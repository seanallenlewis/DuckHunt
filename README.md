Duck Hunt

Javascript-based, simplified version of the Nintendo classic

A two player, quick reflex, action game where users alternate turns, moving their cursor to try and 'shoot' down as many ducks as they can in the time allowed. The score is tallied for each 'kill' and the player with the most at the end of the game, wins. 
 
Controls

Use the mouse cursor to move your cross hairs about the screen. Once you have a duck in your sights, click mouse 1 to pull the trigger and watch your score go up while the ducks go down.

Development process

Technologies used: 
HTML / CSS / Javscript + jQuery

Random Number Generation: 
	The heart of this game relies heavily on random number generation. You see this the function "GenRandomNumber" used heavily throughout the app file. 
All 'duck' pathing is done with random number generation to Top and Left coordinates, animate to those coordinates and call on itself again to a new random set of coordinates. 
	The clouds in the background use a random number selection to pull the height of their vertical placement and the speed of horizontal movement. The function that places the cloud image relies on a random number to select which of the 4 cloud images it will set in motion. 

Interval Madness:

setInterval - 
I've collected a couple of setInterval examples in this project. Timing the production of clouds, the countdown window into each player's turn, and the large timer feature all depend on "setInterval".

setTimeout-
setTimeout is responsible for the fast flash/visual effects of the gun shot as well as the length of time the windows for evaluating player performance and identifying the winner stay in place.

User Stories

As a user, I am greeted with a bit of nostalgia and similar gameplay to the original Nintendo version of the NES Zapper assisted, classic, Duck Hunt. 

As a user, my quick reflexes will amass me a high enough score to win a game and not only will it be me telling my current adversary that they are a loser, but the game will crown me as the victor as well.

As a user, i am prompted of an upcoming round, and when it starts, I see flying ducks that visually respond to a direct click of the mouse.

As a player, if I enjoyed myself, if the game end in a tie, I will be prompted with a way to replay from the beginning.
