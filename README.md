Duck Hunt

Javascript-based, simplified version of the Nintendo classic

A two player, quick reflex, action game where users alternate turns, moving their cursor to try and 'shoot' down as many ducks as they can in the time allowed. The score is tallied for each 'kill' and the player with the most at the end of the game, wins. 
 
Controls

Use the mouse cursor to move your cross hairs about the screen. Once you have a duck in your sights, click to pull the trigger and watch your score go up, while the ducks go down.

User Stories

As a user, I am greeted with a bit of nostalgia and similar gameplay to the original. As a user, I can amass a high score, win a game, and tell my current adversary that they are a loser.
